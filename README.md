# Data Engineering - NBA Salary Prediction

#### Description
The focus of this project is to source data from various sources, each contributing additional information regarding the sport, and store them within a constructed database. Following this, the data is manipulated to help evaluate the efficacy of various machine learning models in their predictive capacity in determining NBA player salary. The models are then deployed for end-users to view the results.

#### Data Sources
- ESPN
- Twitter
- Basketball Reference
- NBA.com

#### Background
As one of the most viewed sports globally, many ponder the question of how much the athletes are paid. The investment each team makes in their players is a crucial decision. Therefore, a good model that can provide a valuable estimate can assist managers in ascertaining whether the salary they are paying is merited. Players themselves can also identify areas to improve to increase their bargaining power.

#### Variables Inputted to Model 
Age, Height, Position, Week Tweets (total tweets in previous week), MPG (minutes per game), efg_pct (effective field goal percentage), TRBPG (total rebounds per game), APG (assists per game), SPG (steals per game), BPG (blocks per game), TOPG (turnovers per game), PPG (points per game).

#### Tools Utilised
- Python
- SQL
- PySpark
- Streamlit
- AWS
- Google Cloud Platform
